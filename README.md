# api-code-quiz
This application uses a web browser as a canvas creating a miniature coding quiz. It is done by combining HTML, CSS, and functionality with the help of Javascript and web APIs. 
Once the app is first opened the user is greeted with the title screen and instructions on how to complete the coding quiz. They are given the options to view previos highscores or start a new quiz. If the user chooses to start a new quiz they will go through a series of coding questions and attempt to get the best score possible. The score is based on how well the user answers the questions and how long they take to answer all of the questions. Each time the user gets a question wrong it will result in a 10 point deduction in their overall score/time. After all of the questions have been completed, the user is brought to the end screen which allows them to save their scores along with their initials. This project was fun and allowed me to work with HTML buttons and Javascript functions.
